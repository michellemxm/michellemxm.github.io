                            <p>There are mechanical vibrations all around us. Even when you are talking, the vibrations
                                from the sound is resulting in subtle vibrations of the objects' surfaces around you. We
                                can extract these vibrations if we instrument a sensor that converts the vibration into
                                electrical signal, and the signal sent to a receiving device like a computer can be
                                later played back into sound again.</p>
                            <div class="full-width-image">
                                <img src="image/vissh/context@2x.png" alt="ZEUSSS Context"
                                    class="content-img-full lightbox-image">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-layout-split">

                                <p>That is exactly what ZEUSSS does. ZEUSSS, Zero Energy Ubiquitous Sound Sensing
                                    Surface,
                                    is a flexible self-powered microphone with signal communication capability developed
                                    by
                                    COSMOS Team. The way it senses sound is based on the principle of static
                                    electricity.
                                    When two materials come in contact, they exchange charges. ZEUSSS is made from a FTP
                                    film and a copper coated paper. When there's sound, the films vibrate and produce
                                    electrical signal. So the sound sensing process of ZEUSSS is self-sustained.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>The main challenge I encountered in this project is that I have a technology, not a
                                design problem. An extra round of exploratory research was conducted before I was able
                                to enter the main house of UCD.</p>

                            <p>In order to find a promising area that ZEUSSS can create value, I started off by doing
                                exploratory interviews with experienced practitioners from 7 different industries. The
                                purpose of the interviews was to explore how this technology can be applied to their
                                industries, to discover potential problem space and then identify an area I should focus
                                on.</p>

                            <p>Literature review and online research on Smart Homes were conducted to explore the
                                problem space and discover existing user problems. Based on the research findings, I
                                synthesized the key values of ZEUSSS and further defined the problems I would like to
                                address through the design.</p>

                            <p>Inspired by the problem discovered through previous study and insights from the user
                                research, I did the first round of brainstorm and then integrated the ideas into 3 main
                                concepts.</p>

                                <h4>Concept 1: An embedded gesture-based controller for smart home appliances</h4>
                                <p>It is designed to be either embed or attach ZEUSSS patch(removable) to any surface in
                                    the
                                    household and to be used as a remote controller to control home appliances. The
                                    problem
                                    addressed is to provide a unified and ubiquitous controller to control smart home
                                    appliances so as to save the time and effort to look for the right app or remote
                                    controller.</p>
                                <p>Two interaction models were developed based on the concept. In the first model, each
                                    patch is dedicated to a specific home appliance and is embedded at where the user
                                    would
                                    normally interact with that appliance. Each appliance can be controlled by multiple
                                    patches. In the second model, each patch was not preassigned what it controls. The
                                    user
                                    needs to assign the patch through a set of gestures and then control the appliance.

                                <p>It is shipped as a sheet of sticker patch and each patch can be linked to an item
                                    through
                                    a mobile application. When it is linked, the user will be able to add a home supply

                                    grocery item to the shopping list. The concept is to release the user's memory

                                users were recruited. In the session, participants provided feedback based on the sketch
                                and interaction description of each concept, and then evaluated the concepts from these
                                5 perspectives by filling out a Likert scale questionnaire. The qualitative data were
                                analyzed using affinity mapping.</p>

                                In order to validate the design directions, I created an online survey to ask about
                                current user experience using smart home appliances and also mobile or wearable smart
                                devices when the users are at home.

                                the challenge they encountered, a lot of people filled in battery and charging.
                                Actually, it is one of the main reasons that they cannot carry or wear the device while
                                they are at home.</p>

                                at home, enabling onbody voice interactions with the speaker at every spot within your
                                household. It is wireless, thin, and flexible so that you can carry it around with you

                            <h3>Prototype</h3>
                            <p>A set of hardware prototype was made In order to conduct a usability test, including a
                                concept model prototype which gives the user the touch and feel of the form factor, and
                                an interactive prototype which simulates the interactions for evaluating the user
                                experiences.</p>

                            <h4>Concept Model Prototype</h4>
                            <p>The concept model prototype consists of a ZEUSSS microphone, and a 2.13-inch flexible
                                e-ink display module. The two electronic elements were glued on a soft female Velcro
                                patch. 2 strips of male Velcro patch were stitched on the cuff of a shirt, so that the
                                VISSH patch can be attached to and removed from the shirt easily.</p>

                            <h4>Interactive Prototype</h4>
                            <p>The interactive prototype was developed using Raspberry Pi, Google AIY Voice kit and
                                Google Assistant API. When the VISSH patch is plugged into the Raspberry Pi, the
                                microphone on Google AIY Voice kit capture sounds constantly and the Assistant API
                                enables the prototype to recognize what people are talking to it. The prototype wakes up
                                to hot words 'OK Google' and 'Hey Google', and responds to voice commands. (Header pin
                                mapping: green for Google AIY Voice Kit, blue for e-paper display)</p>

                            <h4>User Interface Templates</h4>
                            <p>To improve the glanceability of the content displayed on the e-ink display, and reduce
                                the required effort for the user to read the information, a set of user interface
                                templates were designed. Template 1 applies to scenarios including asking the weather,
                                commute condition, address, etc. Template 2 applies to scenarios like asking Google
                                questions, business information, calendar/schedule, setting/retrieving reminder and
                                grocery list, etc. And Template 3 is designed for smart home controls like controlling
                                music, video streaming, adjusting thermostats, turning on and off lights, etc.</p>

                                    <h4>UIs for the Different Interaction States</h4>
                                    <p>The second change is to design UIs to show states when the VISSH patch is
                                        listening
                                        and when it finishes listening and start to request data. It is designed to make
                                        sure
                                        that the user knows when the patch is interactable so that the user will not
                                        feel
                                        confused while waiting for the response to come back. This also mitigates the
                                        privacy
                                        concern as when the patch wakes up to the hot words and is actively listening,
                                        the
                                        user could
                                        tell from the interface.</p>

                                    <h4>Physical Switch and Sound Capturing Range</h4>
                                    <p>Another refinement is to address the privacy issue through hardware changes. A
                                        physical switch was added with a color-coded indicator. The user can turn it off
                                        when he/she
                                        does not want to be heard.<br>
                                        Also through adjusting the size of ZEUSSS patch integrated here as the
                                        microphone,
                                        the sound capturing range can be adjusted. According to the usability test
                                        insight,
                                        an
                                        arm-length range is preferred. While the device is not being used, the user
                                        could
                                        keep it at somewhere else, for example, in the drawer, so that the sound
                                        capturing
                                        is
                                        disabled due to distance.</p>

                            <h3>Future Work</h3>
                            <p>To achieve more desirable user experiences, there are technical explorations as well as
                                further user studies needed to be done. Currently, ZEUSSS is made of FTP and
                                copper-coated paper. Even though the use cases for VISSH are limited to the indoor
                                environment, a wearable device tends to have a considerable amount of wearing, folding,
                                and maybe tearing while being used. Durability is a significant concern in designing a
                                consumer-facing wearable. Alternative materials that is more durable, and anti-wear and
                                tear, are more desirable.<br>
                                Signal communication technology needs further research as well. The first problem needed
                                to be resolved is how to give a unique ID to each patch so that the system could
                                identify which patch is being used and to which patch the response should be sent to.
                                Also, analog backscatter, which is currently used for ZEUSSS's data communication, has a
                                limited range. Other technologies with a better range like BLE or Wifi require higher
                                power, which adds difficulties to power harvesting and battery capacity.<br>
                                From the user research perspective, testing the concept with higher fidelity prototype,
                                especially with a wireless version which the user can actually wear on the body, is the
                                next step. Usability tests completed in this project were task-based and the
                                participants were sitting the whole time. Experimenting the concept in a more realistic
                                household environment with the participant walking around will give the participant more
                                pertinent experience as to how this should be in real use cases.</p>
