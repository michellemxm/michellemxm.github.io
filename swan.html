				<div class="overview-column">
					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<p>There is a growing need for a portable, practical, and highly functional navigation aid for
						individuals who experience vision loss.
						This can include temporary situations, such as firefighters navigating smoke-filled buildings,
						as well as long-term or permanent blindness.
						In all cases, users must be able to move safely, avoid obstacles, and learn about their
						surroundings.
						An audio-only interface offers significant advantages by guiding listeners along a path while
						simultaneously indicating the presence of landmarks, hazards, or other important environmental
						features.
						Such an approach ensures that users are not solely dependent on vision to build a reliable
						mental map of their environment.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="overview-column">
					<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
					<p>The SWAN project addresses this need by developing a navigation system that integrates indoor
						navigation technology with audition.
						Tools such as augmented reality kits and Bluetooth beacons enable precise location tracking,
						while auditory cues provide accurate directional guidance that can rival visual localization.
						By giving users greater control of their environment, the system enhances safety and autonomy
						for people with vision impairments and supports first responders in vision-limiting situations.
						Beyond assisting those with low or no vision, it also improves efficiency for sighted users in
						multitasking scenarios, making indoor navigation more effective and versatile for a wide range
						of needs.</p>

							<h3>Designing a <span class="highlight">spatial audio–guided</span> indoor navigation system</h3>
							<p>The system we built is a wearable auditory interior navigation system. It has an AR
								mobile application, and a bluetooth bone conduction headphone. When users open the
								application, they are able to see the 3D map of the building they are currently in.
								There are semi-transparent green cylinders, which stands for the waypoints that map out
								the route to help with the navigation. They would hear a spatialized sound from the bone
								conduction headphone that directs them to the waypoint.</p>

								<h4>GVU Demo Day</h4>
								<p>We have developed a low-fidelity version of the SWAN Audio-based AR mobile
									application for GVU Demo Day and conducted more than 10 casual testings during the
									demo session. This version includes a simplified hallway interior with 6 checkpoints
									along the hallway as well as an audio environment sound for a door on the designed
									navigating path. The geometry of the 3D modeling is rather simple, which only
									contains a rectangular-shaped hallway and a room at one side.</p>

						<!-- Test Process subsection -->
						<div class="content-layout-text">
							<h5>Test Process</h5>
							<p>The participants were asked to stand at a designed starting point, and launch the mobile
								application. Due to the limitation of the Unity ARKit, the users needed to hold the
								mobile phone straight for a few second to allow the application to detect the floor as
								reference plane and then plot the AR geometry accordingly. The participants needed to
								orient themselves according to the audio cues, and the mobile phone's camera was
								required to face the same direction of their head as mobile application was using the
								camera to detect the location.</p>
							<p>The participants then passed 3 checkpoints walking away from the starting point to the
								other end of the hallway, and headed back for checkpoint 4. The audio cue then directed
								the participants to checkpoint 5 which was located in the room we designed. And the
								journey ended at the last checkpoint which led the participants back to the starting
								area.</p>
						</div>

						<!-- Findings subsection -->
						<div class="content-layout-text">
							<h5>Findings</h5>
							<p>The main findings include two aspects, including audio cue perception and cognition, and
								body motion and mounting methods. There are 3 types of audio cue in the system now -
								continuous audio beacon, checkpoint confirmation, obstacle/barrier/physical environment
								alert. All participants demonstrated no confusion about the audio confirmation, but the
								other two caused misinterpretation to some extent. Also, a number of participants found
								difficult to recognize the audio source's direction. And there is no audio cue for user
								to determine whether they are pointing at the right direction.</p>
							<p>Besides, people's interpretations to the audio cues vary enormously. Even the
								participants have been instructed to 'go to checkpoint at where the audio source is
								located', some of them still felt confused when they were trying to find their way
								following the sound cue. Some people indicated that it is hard to distinguish the
								frequency increase/decrease with a relatively small displacement. One stated that he
								need to stride back and forth to find out whether he is heading towards the checkpoint.
							</p>
							<p>As per body motion issue, most of participants did not indicate that they felt
								inconvenience when they are told to rotate their body with the camera during the test
								runs, probably they had more patience for demos as compared to actual products. Less
								than half of participants forgot to rotate their body when they were trying to make to
								the checkpoint and they rotated their heads instead as a more natural reaction.</p>
						</div>

						<!-- Potential Research Questions subsection -->
						<div class="content-layout-text">
							<h5>Potential Research Questions</h5>
							<p>Based on our findings, we identified several key research questions for future
								investigation:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Experiment whether adding confirmation sound for direction will improve clarity for
									the wayfinding process (Test with/without the direction confirmation audio cue with
									other variables controlled).</li>
								<li>Define a proper curve to map the frequency of audio beacon to the actual distance
									between the user and the checkpoint.</li>
								<li>Number of checkpoints between starting point and destination.</li>
								<li>Examine the usability of head-mount and chest-mount.</li>
								<li>Conduct experiments for both with vision and blindfolded and see whether there is
									correlation with vision and audio-based wayfinding.</li>
							</ul>

								<h4>Pilot Hallway Testing</h4>
								<p>We conducted a pilot hallway testing on the medium fidelity prototype of SWAN. For
									this version, we built the 3D model of the second floor of JS Coon building using
									Sketchup, then imported the model into Unity. The 3D model included all
									constructional features of the interior, such as pillars, doorways, and rooms. It
									did not contain furnitures and other items installed after construction.</p>

						<!-- Test Process subsection -->
						<div class="content-layout-text">
							<h5>Test Process</h5>
							<p>This pilot run was conducted with our team member. The starting point was located inside
								Sonification Lab and the user need to meet the first checkpoint in front of the lab's
								door, make a left turn walking to the common area to find the checkpoints 2 to 4, and
								the audio cues led the user to find the last two checkpoints located near the lift at
								the corner.</p>
						</div>

						<!-- Findings subsection -->
						<div class="content-layout-text">
							<h5>Findings</h5>
							<p>Since it was an internal testing conducted by a project team member, we considered the
								participant familiar enough with the system. She was able to perceive, recognize and
								interpret the audio cue clearly and easily. The pilot test revealed problems which were
								more on the technical side rather than the user experience side.</p>
							<p>The most crucial issue was that the indoor location the system obtained via mobile
								phone's camera drifted severely as the increase of indoor geometry complexity. When the
								user passed through a door or walked from a narrow corridor into the open common area,
								the system often lost context and was not able to pinpoint the accurate location.
								Without a stable and accurate location data, the system was not be able to perform
								following navigating tasks as designed. We also noted that keeping the camera straight,
								walking and turning slower could reduce the frequency of drifting to some extent.</p>
							<p>As navigating while walking is the main use scenario of this system, the pace of walking
								and speed of turning are considered very important to the entire experience. Ideally, we
								do not want the participants to walk at an abnormally slow speed. In this case, we
								decided to explore other indoor location technologies, for instance, Indoor Atlas, and
								integrate them into the system to reduce drifting and increase location accuracy.</p>

					<div class="content-section" id="future-research">

							<span class="content-label">next steps</span>
							<h3>Future Research Plan</h3>
							<p>In future, we plan to build different versions of the prototype and recruit more
								participants to do the tests. We want to build the versions based on two manipulations:
								"environment complexity", which includes both falloff and how many non-waypoint sounds
								are enabled; and "waypoint density", which is whether waypoints are far apart, or close
								together. We want to include these two variables because we are interested in the
								different performance trade offs present. If we include few waypoints in the model, we
								rely on the environment sounds to help with obstacle avoidance; or we can also include
								many waypoints to guarantee users can take an optimal path, but the sounds might be
								annoying. So the matrix of the testing variables would be like:</p>

							<table class="content-table">
								<tr>
									<th></th>
									<th>Many waypoints</th>
									<th>Few waypoints</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>High density of environment sounds</th>
									<td></td>
									<td></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Low density of environment sounds</th>
									<td></td>
									<td></td>
								</tr>
							</table>

							<p>In addition to these two variables, we also need to have four different courses in
								different parts of the building with roughly the same number of objects and waypoints in
								order to get more unbiased results. In total we will have 16 versions of the prototype
								because we will have four courses for each of the combinations shown in the above
								matrix. Participants can start in slightly different parts of the building, but each
								should generally cover the same sorts of areas, and should have (a) the same number of
								waypoints and (b) approximately the same distance traveled. We plan to recruit 20
								participants for initial testings, then recruit more participants if the initial
								testings show promising results.</p>
							<p>Besides conducting more tests on different versions of current prototype, the study can
								be brought further by developing and integrating more accurate indoor location
								technology. The current prototype sometimes has drifts when user walks. The performance
								would be greatly improved if the location of the user can be more precisely tracked.</p>
