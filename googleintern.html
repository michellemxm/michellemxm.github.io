                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>I spent my 2018 summer as a User Experience Design Intern on the Google Hardware UX team in
                        Mountain View.
                        The intern project's mission is to vision and visualize key user experiences and use cases for
                        Googleâ€™s 2019 - 2020 hardware products.
                        In the 13-week-long internship, I identified unique value of each device in Google hardware
                        ecosystem, defined 12 cross-product high value opportunities, created detailed storyboards, and
                        designed key user experiences and interactions.
                        <br>Due to Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, the work is only available for Googlers
                        with permission.

                                <h3>Thriving in Ambiguity</h3>
                                <p>When I started working on my intern project, I was confused because the topic was
                                    very
                                    open. The project scope included multiple hardware products and there were unlimited
                                    directions for me to explore. Intimidating as it could be, I soon kicked off by
                                    doing
                                    these:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Starting with the very basic step helped me start rolling - project planning. A
                                        solid timeline with tasks and deliverables can tell me what I should be doing at
                                        a
                                        certain point. This project required diverging and converging for several times,
                                        but
                                        keeping up the pace always pushed me to absorb information quickly, reach out to
                                        people proactively and ask for resources when needed.</li>
                                    <li>Knowing what has been done is a necessary step to know what can we do next. Due
                                        to
                                        the classified nature of this project, I was not able to conduct user research
                                        or
                                        have any direct contact with the end user. Luckily, I was sitting with a number
                                        of
                                        designers who were in charge of the user experience design of different hardware
                                        products, and our UX research team was right next to my desk. I completed more
                                        than
                                        ten 1:1 meetings with the designers and researchers within the first two weeks
                                        to
                                        get to know the users.</li>
                                    <li>Read. Secondary research is an effective and efficient way to catch up with
                                        knowledge. I dug into all relevant user study and research documents I could
                                        find so
                                        as to know the products from functional, technical, human-factor perspectives
                                        and so
                                        forth.</li>
                                    <li>Diverge, converge and repeat. Design, according to Buxton's <a class="text-link"

                                        is the overlap between "Elaboration" (a process for opportunity-seeking) and
                                        "Reduction" (a process for decision-making). Every convergence leads to a more
                                        defined problem space and then divergence brings more alternatives of the design
                                        solutions.</li>

                            <h3>Be idealistically practical</h3>
                            <p>Taking on a visionary project was not easy. The experience taught me to be idealistic, be
                                wild but also be grounded and be practical.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>It is always the goal for a UX designer to design for the ideal user experiences. As
                                    we brainstorm, always ask a lot of 'yes, and?' questions. And don't limit our
                                    thought with technical knowledge we know as there is always something we don't know.
                                </li>
                                <li>It is also part of a UX designer's job to know how - how to implement this concept
                                    technically and how much it will cost. A design can only benefit the users when it
                                    is launched. It is equally important to understand the products' capabilities and
                                    constraints so as to leverage existing product functionalities, tailor and implement
                                    the concept.</li>
                                <li>Don't be frightened by how much effort it takes to create new experiences. If we see
                                    a pain point and the user can truly benefit from the design solution, we should push
                                    a little on the engineering side as long as it is worthwhile.</li>

                            <h3>An eye on the bigger picture <br>and an eye on the granular details</h3>
                            <p>As a junior designer, sometimes we tend to focus on our project only, missing out the
                                bigger vision the team and the company is trying to achieve. Although the intern
                                project's scope became very focused on certain use cases at the end, it was still part
                                of the entire hardware ecosystem. Collaborating with multiple seasoned designers who
                                work towards better user experience of the entire hardware ecosystem, I learned how to
                                think systematically and how to integrate different products in different use cases.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand the key strengths and strong user cases of different products. Each
                                    hardware product has its own traits and hence the use scenarios may vary.</li>
                                <li>Think about how to leverage each product's capabilities so that multiple products
                                    can work together to provide a holistic experience to the user.</li>
                                <li>Be consistent across different platforms so that interactions always go along with
                                    the user's mental model and induce less cognitive burden.</li>
                                <li>Take good care of the gaps between products when multiple products coexist in the
                                    scenario. Interaction not only happens with a particular product but also across
                                    multiple products.</li>
                                <li>I was amazed by the high-quality visual design of outputs other designers delivered.
                                    Always paying attention to details and delivering high-standard visuals are not only
                                    proof of professionality, but also a good habit as a designer.</li>

                            <h3>Be an effective and efficient collaborator</h3>
                            <p>It was an extremely valuable experience for me to work on a cross-functional team. I had
                                the chance to work with different roles within and outside my team, including engineers,
                                researchers, designers from other team/product areas, etc. I also shadowed my host in
                                cross-team meetings which gave me plenty of insights about collaboration.</p>

                            <h4>Collaborate with people who are different from you</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be curious and be respectful of the differences. Everyone brings different
                                    perspectives and insights to the table so that we can have diversity in thinking.
                                </li>
                                <li>Think in their way and speak their language. When we try to communicate with
                                    someone, understanding how he/she thinks about it and why he/she thinks in that way
                                    lift the communication barrier. Talking to them in their language help convey our
                                    thoughts clearer and easier.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Objective-oriented meetings</h4>
                            <p>People were extremely generous in committing their time to help me out and I was
                                grateful. Before running any meeting, I would make sure it's not a waste of time.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Come up with an agenda and share it with people being invited to attend. Also share
                                    the relevant documents alongside with the invitation so that people will know what
                                    they are expecting.</li>
                                <li>Have a clear goal of the meeting and what to get out of the meeting. Brief the
                                    context to the audience at the beginning.</li>
                                <li>Prepare a concise presentation deck. "A good visual is 10 times stronger than words"
                                    Taabi, my host, said and I quote. Before I run any meeting or present my design to
                                    anyone, I was always encouraged to prepare a deck beforehand. With the visualization
                                    of ideas and thoughts, the audience could understand what we were discussing
                                    quickly.</li>
                                <li>Work the audience through the design decision making process if someone raises
                                    concerns. Try not to skip steps of thinking and elaborate the reasoning clearly
                                    because people cannot read minds.</li>
                                <li>Keep a meeting minute and do a short recap at the end so that everybody is on the
                                    same page.</li>
                                <li>Share the deck and meeting minute afterward. People sometimes leave comments and new
                                    thoughts in the document. And I often got inspired by those.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                            <p>I have run several design critiques with my team and with designers from other teams
                                    at the different stage of my project during the summer. Here are some thoughts about
                                    design critiques.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When your design is on the table, it's no longer your baby - difficult as it
                                        could
                                        be, try to detach the emotion from it and look at it with a fresh eye.</li>
                                    <li>When people give comments or criticisms to the design, also ask why they think
                                        that
                                        way.</li>
                                    <li>People would ask very different questions as you present low-fidelity or high
                                        fidelity designs. When a low-fi prototype is being presented, people tend to
                                        more
                                        focus on the high-level concept and interactions. People start to ask more
                                        details
                                        about the micro-interactions, technical feasibilities, and user interfaces as
                                        the
                                        fidelity go higher. So prepare the right prototype according to the goal of the
                                        design critique and be clear what kind of feedback is needed.</li>
                                    <li>Animate the user flow if necessary. I found a short animation could be clearer
                                        than
                                        a series of slides. This internship project further honed my animation skills.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
